# CalendarBot

This is the official submission of our team for [NUS Hack and Roll 2020](https://devpost.com/software/calendarbot).

The aim of this project is to provide an easy interface for users to create Google Events, without leaving the telegram app.

The bot uses NLP to parse the user's message and then create an event in their Google Calendar for them. The user is also able to edit the event details if necessary!

To run this locally add your telegram bot token in telebot.py

A demo of this can be seen as below --
